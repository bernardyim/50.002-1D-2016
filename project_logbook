Project log:
Project is counted in Days, with each meeting considered as a Day.

General chronological log:
Day 0:
-Downloaded and installed ISE and Mojo IDE on team's workstations
-Read through the first FPGA program tutorial

Day 1:
-Go through the following tutorials together as a team:
--first FPGA program together
--Synchronous logic
--IO shield
-Explore and understand the syntax of MOJO and Lucid

Day 2:
-Coded ALU bare-minimum as required for ALU Functionality
-Decided to include following functionality: Greater than / greater-equals, divide, multiply


Design considerations:
Considering how the ALU is 8-bit, we decided to keep the output of the ALU as 8-bits as well, and utilise the remaining LED arrays for the following purposes:
-Overflowed output 
-a == b
-Error-checking and diagnosis for testing

We also decided to map io_dip[0] as the array "alufn", io_dip[1] as "a", and io_dip[2] as "b", in a bid to make the code more readable. 

The output of the ALU is mapped as such:
-io_led[0] : output of ALU
-io_led[1] : diagnostic output of ALU, consisting of (0 -> overflow, 1 -> a == b)
